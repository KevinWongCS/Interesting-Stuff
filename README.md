## Different types of sensors
[```Sensors```](https://medium.com/jay-tillu/mobile-sensors-the-components-that-make-our-smartphones-smarter-4174a7a2bfc3)\
Letâ€™s see standard sensors that your smartphone is having.
* ```Accelerometer```
  * The accelerometer detects axis-based motion sensing. It senses the changes in the orientation of smartphones with respect to x, y, and z-axis. 
* ```Ambient Light Sensor```
  * Detects the light around your environment. Your screen's auto brightness is working because of this sensor. 
* ```Ambient Temperature Sensor```
  * Detects the temperature around your environment.
* ```Air Humidity Sensor```
  * Detects the humidity around your environment.
* ```Barometer Sensor```
  * Detects the atmospheric pressure, can also detect distance from sea level. And it can assist in the GPS to accurately determine your location. This sensor can also help your phone track steps your walk.
* ```Finger Print Sensor```
  * Creates a map of your fingerprint.
* ```Gyroscope Sensor```
  * An advanced accelerometer. An accelerometer detects axis-based motion sensing, Gryoscopes works with accelerometer and detects each degree of changes in orientation, which provides a higher degree of motion sensing.
* ```Harmful Radiation Sensor```
  * sensor is used to detect harmful radiation in nearby environment.
* ```Magnetometer```
  * measures magnetic fields and can tell where is north. Used for a compass in your phone. 
* ```NFC Sensor```
  * Near field communication sensor, two devices can communicate if they are within 4cm of each other. Very common in smart phones today. 
* ```Proximity Sensor```
  * Detects the proximity of an object. During calls, your screen goes off via the proximity sensor.
* ```Pedometer Sensor```
  * Advanced version of accelerometer. It is used to track steps more accurately than a accelerometer.
