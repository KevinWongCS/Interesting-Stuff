## Different types of sensors
[```Sensors```](https://medium.com/jay-tillu/mobile-sensors-the-components-that-make-our-smartphones-smarter-4174a7a2bfc3)
* ```Accelerometer```
  * The accelerometer detects axis-based motion sensing. It senses the changes in the orientation of smartphones with respect to x, y, and z-axis. 
* ```Ambient Light Sensor```
  * Detects the light around your environment. Your screen's auto brightness is working because of this sensor. 
* ```Ambient Temperature Sensor```
  * Detects the temperature around your environment.
* ```Air Humidity Sensor```
  * Detects the humidity around your environment.
* ```Barometer Sensor```
  * Detects the atmospheric pressure, can also detect distance from sea level. And it can assist in the GPS to accurately determine your location. This sensor can also help your phone track steps your walk.
* ```Finger Print Sensor```
  * Creates a map of your fingerprint.
* ```Gyroscope Sensor```
  * An advanced accelerometer. An accelerometer detects axis-based motion sensing, Gryoscopes works with accelerometer and detects each degree of changes in orientation, which provides a higher degree of motion sensing.
* ```Harmful Radiation Sensor```
  * sensor is used to detect harmful radiation in nearby environment.
* ```Magnetometer```
  * measures magnetic fields and can tell where is north. Used for a compass in your phone. 
* ```NFC Sensor```
  * Near field communication sensor, two devices can communicate if they are within 4cm of each other. Very common in smart phones today. 
* ```Proximity Sensor```
  * Detects the proximity of an object. During calls, your screen goes off via the proximity sensor.
* ```Pedometer Sensor```
  * Advanced version of accelerometer. It is used to track steps more accurately than a accelerometer.

## Entrepreneurship

* [```Inventing and Innovation```](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyugyrCQTuw)
  * Innovation flourishes with opposing ideas.
  * Innovation is better w/o a traditional work hierarchy because it is unlikely the idea is to reach or to be had by someone above.
  * Get expert opinions.
  * Being playful and disagreeable vs. being agreeable 
  * Defer judgement, don't criticize
  * Build on the idea of others. "Yes" "And"
  * Wide ideas or a general idea can be honed into a more specific one. "Focused chaos"
  * Trial and Error > lone genius
  * It's not a eureka moment, but a process and hard work
  * Have to work under time constraints, or else it can go on forever
  * Try first, ask for forgiveness later? ok...
  * Some of the simplest products tend to be the most successful products

### Notes from [MITopencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-390-new-enterprises-spring-2013/video-tutorials/lecture-1/)
* ```SME (small market enterprise)```
   * serves local markets
   * growth is natural log of x (ln x), which means it tapers off
* ```IME (innovation driven enterprise)```
   * serves global markets
   * requires more initial capital
   * unique service or innovation that addresses much broader markets
   * growth can potentially be exponential
   * very different from a small market enterprise
   * more risk
* ```Innovation```
   * Innovation != Invention
   * Innovation generates values, does something better, faster, cheaper.
   * Invention is an idea, a technology, a patent. By itself it doesn't generate value.
   * ```Innovation == Invention * Commercialization```
   * It is only when invention is combined with commercialization that an ideas value can be realized.
   * Commercialization is more difficult than innovation, but one cannot exist without the other for entrepreneurship
* ```Types of innovation```
   * Technological
   * Process
   * Business model 
   * Positioning
   * Others
* ```Categories of innovation```
   * Disruptive
   * Incremental
   * Lateral or general 
   * Not all innovation has to be disruptive
* ```Types of entrepreneurs```
   * Someone with a tech solution looking for a market
      * possible competitive advantage
      * high risk
   * Someone with an idea to improve the business model. They know the market well.
      * market is already been indentified, so no competitive advantage
      * less risk
   * Someone who is passionate
      * People with a passion isn't enough to become an entrepreneur
      * You either have to have a technology or an idea
      * Probably has to join someone with a technology or an idea
   * ```note: consider knowledge, capability, connections, financials, name recognition, credibility, passion, and commitment```
* ```Myths```
   * aren't the smartest people in the room
   * aren't the highest achievers, but very focused on a few things
   * no entrepreneur makes it on their own
   * entrepreneurs don't come from parents that are entrepeneurs. It is a skill that can be acquired
   * entrepreneurs don't love risk, but take on risk where they have a competitive advantage. They are able to de-risk risk.
   * doesn't have to do with charisma. You need a vision from point A to B, relationships, and your own personal touch in the innovation along the way.
   * entrepreneurs are undiscipline. Self discipline is required. "Spirit of a pirate and execution of a naval seal team".
* ```Market segmentation```
   * out of the box thinking/brainstorming
   * primary customer research: what they need and their problems
   * walking in the customers shoes socially and emotionally
   * most important thing to determined the marketability of the product
   * who is the end user
* ```Beachhead market```
   * identify one of the many markets in the market segmentation to focus on
   * why one? because of limited money, time, and human capital
   * don't go after the biggest market, but the one that is easiest to capture
      * has to be big enough to become cash flow positive and can't be too small that we will never see a return
      * looking at all the possibilities you also want to choose one that inspires confidence in what you are doing
* ```Mission```
   * Their goal: have a positive impact on the worlds greatest challenges
   * One of the greatest challenges today is youth growing up and not being able to have jobs
      * entrepreneurship is a solution to that
      * creates hope, pride, and rigor to the youth and entire world
      * jobs won't be there created by government or companies
* ```What makes a business```
   * a paying customer
   * not a plan, ceo, mission statement, product, idea, technology, or market analysis.
   * all the above are second to a PAYING CUSTOMER. This goes back to market segmentation.
   * ```REVERSE ENGINEER FROM A PAYING CUSTOMER AND BUILD FROM THAT```

## Products
[From the United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://www.uspto.gov/)
* ```Features```
   * Are visible to the naked eye
* ```Benefits```
   * You have to explain or tell someone about it
* ```Invention```
   * Something new
   * DO YOUR RESEARCH, in todays age it is very hard to say a product or service has no competitors
* ```Innovation```
   * Making an existing product or service better, cheaper, more efficient, more functional, etc
   * Lacks competitive advantage
   * Alot of good selling products are not inventions, but are a small change on something already existing(reimagined)
* ```Need or want```
   * Is the product or service solve a significant problem or is it a minut problem
* ```Initial production run```
   * Don't mass produce the first batch
   * Find a cost efficient way to product a reasonable amount and test the waters
      * whether it is going to a farmers market, tradeshow, to get real customer feedback
      * USPTO has seen alot of people mass produce products that still require "tweaks" but the first batch has already been made or made/shipped
